The Flappy Game

In my game, the player will earn points by moving the object and each object jump will result in one point. The player must move the object more times while navigating through spaces between two pipes to achieve a high.

The game will display instructions on how to start on the main game screen while their will be a score indicator throughout the game. Once the player hits an obstacle the game will end displaying the score and giving the player instructions on how to play again.

Iâ€™m motivated to make this game cause I have been a fan of Flappy bird since very young and was addicted to it at one point. Hence, as flappy bird is now nowhere on the app store, I wished to recreate my own version of it.

To start the game PRESS ENTER. To Play Again PRESS DELETE. To Jump PRESS SPACE.
